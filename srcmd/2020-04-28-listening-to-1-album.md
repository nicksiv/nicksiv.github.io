## Listening to 1 album

The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a dangerous thing. Especially in music. So I've designed my revolution:\
No more always available playlists with greatest hits and algorithms based on playing history, related bands and a downward spiral towards musical consumerism!\
I'm listening to one album for days. That's all. This way I can understand it. I can sink inside it and take whatever it has to give me.\
I only have to make this choice a couple times a month.\
What's the next album will be?

**Currently** : [Philip Glass Ensemble: Glassworks](https://open.spotify.com/album/1My9AZY0XBwVwwy1DDVSQS)\
**Previously**: [The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery](https://open.spotify.com/album/79403QOWKAE6yeARM4Hjzw)
