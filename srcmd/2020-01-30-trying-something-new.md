## Trying something new

It's always nice to try something new. I don't usually get such opportunities but you never know when you will get one strange idea to try out.

I had one idea regarding to my music listening habits. I always try to listen to albums. Lots of albums over the years. But there are times when I get tired of my choices. There are certain genres, publications and channels, into and outside the mainstream forming our taste in music. When I was younger I used to believe that my music was my choice. Needless to say, I was so wrong about that.

So what music is next? Something unexpected.

A [random album](https://www.randomlists.com/random-albums?qty=1) that I will turn my attention to.

And who knows? Maybe I stumble to something good which wasn't so "hip" for me back then. This can be a refreshing exercise of modesty and humility.
