## Don't ever say 'Whatever you want'

💆

You think saying 'Whatever you want' is something noble and well-mannered. You have good intentions saying that and I cannot disagree with that. But it sucks big time, you know it, even if you won't admit it. Because deep inside you are in denial and all the others can see is a spineless push over.

Are you a push over? Then state your opinion. Nowadays everybody strives to make their own stand out, so what's wrong with you?

Stating opinion says to the other person that you give a damn. You waste some energy to think and make your argument. That's what caring is. You contribute to the making of a decision and you offer yourself to carry its weight along. Don't leave it solely to the other party.

So next time, do care a little.
