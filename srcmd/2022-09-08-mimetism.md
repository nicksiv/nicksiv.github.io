## Mimetism

Reading [this](https://www.epsilontheory.com/25-anti-mimetic-tactics-for-living-a-counter-cultural-life/), I realized that almost everything I do or like is just mimetic desire.

Now I'm asking myself questions like: why do I like the things I like? Why don't I like the things that noone likes?

Apparently there is always some [model](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-101) that tells us what is good to like.

Oh my, how disappointing is this? ðŸ˜ž We are the sum of out models.
