-   I use a Thinkpad T420 w/ 8GB RAM running [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) XFCE.
-   My wallpapers come from [nordic](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers) repo
-   I almost live in [emacs](https://emacs.org/) but sometimes I use vim as an editor.
-   I browse the web with **Firefox-esr**.
-   I listen to music with **mpv** and **EMMS**.

I also use some other great software like cwm, tmux, **syncthing** and nextcloud I\'m also a sucker for systems like arch, openBSD and plan9 which I might dive into when I grow up!
