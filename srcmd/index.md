nyk0-nomikon - welc0me

Welcome to my personal web-space and online notebook!

Â 

I\'m nyk0. I\'m an autodidact programmer and I spend a lot of time tinkering with computers after my dayjob.

This is my dump-notes-I-consider-useful space (aka memex).

If you want to know more about me you can view my [about](about.html) page.
