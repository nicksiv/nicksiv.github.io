## About me 

I've been trying to talk to computers since I was a kid. Mostly failing to do so.\
Now after my workday, I'm a recreational programmer and I spend a lot of time tinkering with my computers, mostly learning.

I support online freedom, privacy rights and free software.

I like sustainable and analog technologies, I enjoy great music and\
films, writing and reading physical books.

I try to take things slow and make things everyday, either code, text or\
drawings. Here is my [Uses](uses.html) page.

## This website

This website has been through lots of rebuilds using numerous software combinations.\
It is now generated just from plain HTML files, and a small and simple\
python script. Needless to say it is still under development.

No scripts or tracking are used in this website.
