## July Music Obsessions

I haven't been writing to my blog as much as I wanted, so I gathered a bunch of music I've discovered, loved and maybe obsessed over.

### Abbey Lincoln

The music is the the magic ([album here](https://open.spotify.com/album/7adPjhJuyYJfvbWgi4YdhJ))

Or how a dead simple lullaby like song can be charged with the blues into a fantastic experience.

### LW Beethoven

Symphony #3 (Eroica): A symphony that became an obsession

[Berliner Philarmoniker w/ HV Karajan album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Xa8CONoChwmnjFjBmka3e)

That was a symphony so hard to approach and I was playing in loop for 3 weeks after watching [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5zFitBASEw)

### Schubert

Erlkonig

There are so many versions of this heavenly inspired work, but my favorite is [this by Jessye Norman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8noeFpdfWcQ&list=PLQY0zQBqYyrXqfNXeekDQyZOjI5_E9Ew4&index=6)
