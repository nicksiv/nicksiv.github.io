## The vimtutor

I'm an **emacs** user and I love **vim** even if I know so little about it. I've learned the basic editing and movement commands and for some reason I got in the habit of using it to edit config files.\
I know I could do that inside emacs, but when I'm working into a terminal I find it faster. And of course it is a great piece of software.

Now on emacs, I found a nice way to load it with a custom config file. That way, creating a minimal config file you can have a very fast emacs into command line to edit text files:\
`emacs -nw -q -l`\
Aliasing this to em I can use it instead of vi.
