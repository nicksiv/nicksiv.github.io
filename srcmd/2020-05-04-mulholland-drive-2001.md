## Mulholland Drive (2001)

It's been more than 24 hours I've finished this film and it still haunts me. Lynch's dreamtopia comments the show business and makes it relatable to everyone. I still don't know why it took me almost 20 years to watch it and stopped at Lost highway. A really mythical symbolic and riddle-filled movie. There are still many theories about it's true meaning, but some things will be always remain unexplained.

Exactly like Lynch wanted to...

> \- It's been a very strange day.
