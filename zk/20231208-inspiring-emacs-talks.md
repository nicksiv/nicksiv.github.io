# Inspiring emacs talks

Emacs is more than an editor. Many say that it's an operating system with a decent editor.ðŸ˜²
This is a list of inspirational emacs related talks I've watched over the years and I would definately suggest for someone interested in finding more about it.


* [Emacs Org-mode - a system for note-taking and project planning: Carsten Dominik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM)
An absolute classic. The 2008 Google Talk by the creator of org-mode.

* [Getting Started With Org Mode: Harry Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4)
This should be watched by anyone who doesn't know about org-mode. Includes demonstration of many of the core features.

* [2019-07-24: All Things Org-Mode: Multiple Speakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31gwvApo8zg&t=3459s)
Mainly the part where John Wiegley explains his org-mode use.

* [Emacs For Writers: Jay Dixit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtieBc3KptU)
A great talk I watched many years ago.

* [Emacs Turbo-Charges My Writing: Jeremy Friesen](https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/writing/)
My latest favorite talk from the EmacsConf 2023, inspired me to get on the emacs train once again.
