# So vast the music...

Interesting lists for today that will keep me busy for a long time (and that's if I won't get bored). 

The first one is from the great <https://rateyourmusic.com> site which I'm very fond of. [Best album in every music genre](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/BlindNoldor/rym-charts-best-album-in-every-music-genre/): There are 2.078 genres with the best album for each. So far (I'm on page 4) I can testify that yes, there are that many genres. A bit over analytic to split music in so many sub-genres but a little browsing will prove that the music anyone listens to is such a small fragment of what's really going on out there! 

The second one is a cool database of jazz records [The Jazzomat Research Project](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html) which contains 456 records including every little piece of info you can imagine including various stats, chords and even music transcription.

Both of those lists really blew my mind and I much respect the people who put work into this! üôè
