I'm trying howm today. It's supposed to be a hidden gem in note taking from Japan.

I've installed it and played with it for a while. It is fast and totally different of what I'm used to. It even has its own todo and scheduling system. Maybe it's too much? We'll see.

It will be refreshing to start again with a new tool but, as other tools the files titles are time stamps. Something that prevents you from working with those files outside of emacs. This is always has been a red flag for me.
