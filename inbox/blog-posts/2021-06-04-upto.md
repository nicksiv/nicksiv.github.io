Things are constantly changing and thatâ€™s a good thing, isnâ€™t it?

So, I was kind of forced to dual boot windows for work reasons (MS Teams is missing serious camera functionality on Linux) after 6 years. I donâ€™t care anymore so much about my operating systems, but the Windows annoyances are still there, and I have to get used to it (like my job). Anyway, with 8GB RAM I admit it runs smoothly.

Except for the classic Office business applications, I only use the Brave browser, Winamp (Iâ€™ve missed this good old media player) and TiddlyDesktop for running a snap of my main wiki. Itâ€™s a fairly small setup.

Iâ€™ve also started to learn touch typing. I have always wanted to do that but never actually did it. [typing club](https://www.typingclub.com) is such a nice application for that. I will need additional practice for learning touch typing in Greek too, but weâ€™ll see how it will go.
