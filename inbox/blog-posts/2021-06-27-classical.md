After being obsessed with classical music for more than a year and I hardly listen to anything else, I found a great course to learn more about it.

It was a 9-week course which was interesting, well laid out and useful. Most importantly, one doesnâ€™t have to understand musical notation or have a background in music theory to follow through. And while I had a sense that the classical music world is huge, now I know that itâ€™s massive. It feels like you are connected to a vast, God-sent, thousand-year inspiration ocean.

Itâ€™s so sad I had to grow much older to appreciate it, but I choose to believe that itâ€™s never too late for greatness!

I highly recommend this Yale university free course to classical music fans: [Introduction to classical music](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introclassicalmusic/home/welcome)
