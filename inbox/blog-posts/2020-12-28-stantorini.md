Being in a constant melancholic state, somewhere in our 50ish day of the current confinement (I hate the term lockdown so much) I brought my memory back 5.5 months ago, in an almost empty, post-covid island of Santorini.

It was strange to be there at first, since there was a record-low number of foreign tourists, but magestic at the same time.

We had the priviledge of witnessing a different Santorini.

That's why you travel. That's why you're trying hard to live memoreable days.
