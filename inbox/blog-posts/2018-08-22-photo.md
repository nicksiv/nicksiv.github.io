I don't remember when I shot the last photo with my phone. I'm sure it's been months.

In the meantime I see everyone else shooting everything. Sunsets, buildings and food. And lots of selfies. Oh God, It seems like yesterday that it was Oxford's [word of the year (2013)](https://www.cnn.com/2013/11/19/living/selfie-word-of-the-year/index.html)! What a revolution.

Now you just shoot and store to the cloud. It's so easy that nobody gets a chance to see a picture let alone print it. I agree with one of my favorite directors that this process is not photography and should get another name. For as long as it lasts.
