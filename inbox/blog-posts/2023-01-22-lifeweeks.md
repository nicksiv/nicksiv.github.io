I have a small project of time lining my life in a file.
For now it's just a flat file with headings for each year I exist.

I converted it to org-mode format and markdown too.

Here, Mr.Benson made an impressive job using a data file, and a jekyll template, which is available on github.

Apparently optimized for web view.
He also makes good yearly reviews: https://buster.medium.com/46-a-blagenflorble-heart-31bc2a992a83

My yearbook like concept.
