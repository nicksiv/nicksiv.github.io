I don't set goals. I never liked them. It is like racing against some unbeatable opponent. They are always subjected to further adjustments and keep reminding you of your own inadequacy. And alright there are SMART goals, you can define it and good luck in finding motivation to follow through.

The thing is, I can't just do what I like without consulting a schedule. I'm a byproduct of the Western productivity cult. I have to manage time the best I can. And doing what I like is not an optimal use of time.

Of course you can set goals ON doing what you love. This would be perfect. But then, maybe you won't love it anymore because you already have an optimal schedule of working 9 to 5.

So, there's the dilemma. Setting goals should make you more successful. Unless it doesn't. But you'll never believe that of course. There is always something more. Something better that you can do. Some different productivity evangelist to follow.

It's a vicious circle.

If you don't know what do you want to accomplish...
