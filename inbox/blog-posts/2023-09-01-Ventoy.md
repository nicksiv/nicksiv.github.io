A multi boot USB is a really useful thing when setting up another linux distro, or need that specific tool to fix partitions, boot records or rescue data. I used to have one but I've erased it over the years. Guess what! I recently needed it so bad, when I had to shrink the only partition on my old laptop to make room for haikuOS.

So, I stumbled upon [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net), which of course is open source and is supported from the most OS types. Its use is really simple. You setup a USB to Ventoy format and just copying all the ISOs you need into its partition.

Booting up the stick, you are presented with a menu to choose which one to boot.

Great tool, I will never erase my USB drive again!
