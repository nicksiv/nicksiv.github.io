Now that I have more free time and I can totally write new posts on this blog I can elaborate on the happy torture of the **infinity loops**.

By infinity loops I'm referring to the endless feeds of information we are facing everyday in our mobile devices.

The time I was spending on my mobile in various apps was way more than I have imagined. And I'm not referring to Facebook (it's been 2 years since I've delete my profile). It was all the rest. Twitter, Reddit, YouTube and recently Netflix. Oh, mobile Netflix. What a way to waste huge amounts of time.

That was until I realized those apps did not offer me any value and I uninstalled all of them. But this isn't so easy as you may think. It is an addiction and like all the other addictions and you are in it **for life**. I didn't make it from the first try. There were times that I was bored or slightly unhappy and cracked. I had quickly installed one of those apps to get a fix.

This is how hooked we all are into this new form of global economy which makes people rich by sucking up our attention. I admit, It took constant struggle but at some point I've made it.

Now the only thing I have in my mobile, is a feed reader and my firefox bookmarks. I've got always something to read but it doesn't lead to a loop. Unfortunately many sites do not offer RSS feeds anymore to make you subscribe into mailing lists and Facebook or Twitter feeds, but oh well!

Who knows what an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss) is nowadays anyway?

The upside from all this? From the time I did this choice, I've been reading more physical books, and I have time to get bored, which had led me to some interesting ideas at last. So, I guess this whole deal is something worth struggling for.
