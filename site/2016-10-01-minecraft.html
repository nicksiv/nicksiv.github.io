    <title>nyk0-nomikon - My first night into the Minecraft
world</title>

  <body>
    <h2>My first night into the Minecraft world</h2>
      <p>It’s been years since I played a computer game. Lost into the
      responsibilities of parenthood, I forgot the fun of it and how
      important that can sometimes be. Luckily my kids reminded me of
      that, because that’s one of the wondrous things that kids do. So,
      while I was constantly bombarded about various Minecraft info from
      them everyday (things like how to make a cake, a diamond sword and
      an armor or how it was in the Nether) the thought to play the game
      started to feel like a good idea and the fact that I had also
      heard about its impressive effect on the world of gaming, made
      this idea even more appealing. Starting it out as an activity to
      perform with the children, I’ve made the decision to go with the
      flow and succumb to the wonderful world of Minecraft. So I
      gathered some info (there is a ton out there), fired up the game
      on my laptop and let the magic happen.</p>
      <p>Needless to say I was under stress while playing the game,
      especially on my first night of survival.</p>
      <h3 id="basic-knowledge">Basic knowledge</h3>
      <p>You begin knowing that each game-day lasts about 10 minutes and
      make your best to gather some basic resources, build a shelter and
      some tools before the night comes and all the monsters start
      creeping around you.</p>
      <p>As a beginner, you need to think and act fast. It will help to
      have prior knowledge of some basic recipes and a plan. That’s the
      reason why there are so many guides. The world of Minecraft is
      enormous, and seems real even if its randomly generated.
      Fortunately, the new versions of Minecraft introduced a recipe
      toolbox so you can learn crafting easily.</p>
      <p><strong>For the first night you need to :</strong></p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Find a tree and Gather some wood by hand (around 25
      blocks)</li>
      <li>Find a hillside and start removing dirt to quickly make a
      shelter</li>
      <li>Make planks out of the wood you have gathered</li>
      <li>Create a crafting table</li>
      <li>Create a wooden pickaxe</li>
      <li>Mine some cobblestone</li>
      <li>Build a furnace</li>
      <li>Cook some wood to make coal</li>
      <li>Create wood sticks and torches (it’s better to have light to
      get through the night)</li>
      <li>Close the shelter and spend the night without stress. You can
      continue safely to mine for more materials (don’t forget the
      torches because monsters keep spawning in dark areas
      anywhere).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first encounters with the monsters are quite scary, hearing
      them crawling over your shelter while you are waiting for the
      Minecraft night to end.</p>
      <p>After surviving my first night, Minecraft was the primary
      subject of conversation between my and my kids. It’s been over a
      year and we still share plans, and I learn new recipes and tips
      from them. I think they feel good teaching their father!</p>
