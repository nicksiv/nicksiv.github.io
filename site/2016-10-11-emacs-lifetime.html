    <h2>Emacs: The editor for a lifetime</h2>
      <p>I’ve always loved text files. When I started building my
      personal productivity system I stumbled upon many solutions and
      tried lots of them. The one thing that always worked for me,
      except for pen and paper was plain text. It was liberating to just
      write what you wanted and being able to access it on any device.
      It was the closest thing to paper you could work on, away from
      proprietary formats that desktop or web application used. Then I
      discovered the todo.txt format along with my first serious
      experiences with Linux. I worked like that for a couple of years,
      but soon I felt the need for something better. My life wasn’t just
      about tasks. There was more to think about, more to handle.</p>
      <h2 id="first-encounter-with-emacs">First encounter with
      Emacs</h2>
      <p>While I was looking for text editors which could apply custom
      syntax highlighting to plain text files, I discovered the Emacs
      text editor. It was old (it was actually started being developed
      in the 70s), the interface seemed outdated and I when I set it up
      for the first time, I couldn’t understand what was so special
      about it. It was just a blank screen with a menu bar and a
      toolbar! I thought it was just an old editor, so I uninstalled it
      and got over with my life.</p>
      <p>Then about 5 years ago, still searching for the perfect text
      based solution, I’ve read somewhere about org-mode. It was an
      Emacs mode that had some features which interested me, or should I
      say I’ve always dreamed about them. I downloaded the manual to my
      mobile phone, started reading it and BANG! This piece of software
      was everything I was looking for and so much more.</p>
      <p>Org-mode was the reason I got hooked into Emacs and learning
      both of them came to be an overall great experience for me. A bit
      hard at times, but so rewarding. I got new knowledge on a great
      open source piece of software which runs almost anywhere, its so
      fast and responsive that modern applications cannot even get close
      to this. And the customization! You can do anything you want, use
      add-ons for your specific needs or even build your own. I haven’t
      got the chance of learning the Emacs language (lisp) yet, but
      there is not need yet.</p>
      <p>After 5 years I’m still excited about Emacs, I’ve never looked
      back since then as many others did. Maybe it fitted to my work
      flow with my development background and my love for shortcut keys
      but honestly, Emacs is one of the most complete and awesome
      applications of the open source.</p>
      <p>Of course one post is not enough on this huge subject and I’m
      planning to elaborate on Emacs further. I will give you a link to
      the <a

      beginners guide to emacs</a> by Jessica Hamrick which I think it’s
      very good.</p></main>
