    <h2>The Johnny.decimal folder structure system</h2>
      <p>Almost a month ago, I was looking for systems to organize my
      folder structure. I have done this a couple of times over the
      years (I’m hard to please for no reason at all) but this was the
      first time I found <a
      href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">johnny.decimal</a>.<br />
      It is a really clever system which is based on numbering a
      specific number of folders for your needs. It needs a bit of
      forward thinking to set it up but I think it can shine on specific
      setups. I think the use of a file explorer is essential for this
      system since you can see all your files nice and tidy.</p>
      <p>I did not settle with johnnydecimal after all, because I like
      really small folder names. Also, the numbering scheme made me
      trying to organize things outside of the filesystem’s scope
      leading me to confusion, but that’s just me.</p>
      <p>It is a really well thought system and I believe it’s worth
      spreading.</p>
