    <title>nyk0-nomikon - Debian: A great choice for 32bit
systems</title>

  <body>
    <h2>Debian: A great choice for 32bit systems</h2>
      <h3 id="the-distro-hoping">The distro hoping</h3>
      <p>I’ve been using Debian on and off for some years now. I
      sometimes test other distributions and sometimes stick to them for
      a while. I know that most of the non-professional Linux lovers
      usually do it. It’s like you like to spend time on your machine,
      but since you are not doing it for a living you feel more free to
      play with all the different options the Linux ecosystem has to
      offer.</p>
      <p>This activity, you can call it a hobby, can be an educational
      toy for a while. After that, you have gone too far and fall into
      the trap. You end up tweaking your system without actually doing
      something useful. I did the same with emacs but that’s another
      story.</p>
      <h3 id="focus-by-constraining">Focus by constraining</h3>
      <p>Anyway, earlier this year, I’ve decided to limit myself in an
      attempt to make some useful work. So I have switched my 7 years
      old Toshiba laptop with my kids’ decade old Toshiba laptop with
      half the RAM I used to (2MB). The kids were pleased they got to
      play a way faster and prettier Minecraft and I was happy to have a
      new challenge!</p>
      <p>My (new) older laptop demands 32bit versions of Linux. So I’ve
      had to make a small research and try out some distros just for the
      fun of it. I knew I would end up with Debian again, but I thought
      why not giving some other distro a chance?</p>
      <p>What I soon found out, was that many distros stopped providing
      32bit versions. There were some choices, and I’ve started testing
      them, having only one requirement. Not to spent much time
      configuring things.</p>
      <h3 id="the-32bit-choices-are-limited">The 32bit choices are
      limited</h3>
      <p>I’ve tried out Fedora. It’s one of my favorite ones, but
      unfortunately I got so many freezes in one day, even in Gnome
      classic that I had to leave it.</p>
      <p>Next I’ve tried Linux Mint MATE which I had a smooth experience
      before with. Disappointed also, from problems of the graphics
      support for my NVIDIA. I had a screen flickering at the top of the
      screen. Like I said before, I did not want to deal with such
      configuration fixes right after installation. So I’ve passed once
      more.</p>
      <p>Then I’ve played with freeBSD for a little while. Besides my
      enthusiasm for the easy installation and the exotic differences,
      I’ve realized that I could not make my NVIDIA work. I knew it
      would take days researching about it, so I’ve took a raincheck,
      promising myself to give it a try sometime in the future (of
      course with another laptop).</p>
      <p>And before I realize it, a week had passed. I knew I had some
      more choices, like the Ubuntu family Xubuntu and Lubuntu. The fact
      was, I couldn’t waste more time on this so I got the Debian 10
      iso, installed it and voila! Everything worked great, right out of
      the box.</p>
      <p>I have only the XFCE desktop environment, and everything flies
      without much customization. I just setup my second keyboard
      layout, add some shortcut keys and dmenu for running programs in a
      flash.</p>
      <p>You see, in that case I’m into the minimal and fast desktop for
      very valid reasons. You cannot run Gnome 3 on such and old
      machine, but that’s the beauty of Linux. The whole lots of
      choices.</p>
