    <title>nyk0-nomikon - My Noguchi filing system</title>

  <body>
    <h2>My Noguchi filing system</h2>
      <p>Everyone needs a good filing system. It is essential to keep
      important documents and retrieve them easily when needed. Some
      people have managed to go totally paperless and scan every
      document in electronic form. Hats off to them because they solved
      a big problem. A problem I have been struggling with for a long
      time.</p>
      <p>For various reasons I did not have the opportunity to put in
      place a full paperless system for my documents. Starting a project
      like this, having a pile of documents spanning over many years,
      needs time and determination.</p>
      <p>Additionally, due to limitations of space in my home desk, I
      could never had one of those fantastic large drawers which you can
      fill with hanged manilla folders. Instead I have been using
      various methods which have never been effective enough.</p>
      <p>Then one day I stumbled upon the <strong>Noguchi</strong>
      system, which could be implemented with large envelopes stacked
      vertically on any shelf. I thought using inexpensive envelopes was
      a great idea and decided to give it a try.</p>
      <h2 id="the-noguchi-method">The Noguchi method</h2>
      <p>The system was really easy to try out, since besides the
      envelopes, scissors and a thin line marker I didn’t need any
      additional gear to set it up.</p>
      <p>I started out by setting up the first envelope. I only needed
      to cut the top right under the opening and write the subject and
      year of the contents on the side. I slipped in the documents to be
      filed and that was all. In about an hour, I had filed a large
      portion of my documents indexed by subject on my shelf. I have
      also added a bookend on the last folder to keep the whole bunch in
      place.</p>
      <p>The only process I’ve decided not to follow, was putting a
      folder on the right side after I have used it. The idea was smart,
      because all the frequently used envelopes would be on the one side
      so it would be easier to retrieve. I thought I would just stick to
      the old good alphabetic order.</p>
      <p>Later I added a small customization, adding small colored
      stickers to specific envelopes I had to use frequently.</p>
      <p>Problem solved.</p>
