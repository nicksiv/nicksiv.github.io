    <title>nyk0-nomikon - Classical Music</title>

  <body>
    <h2>Classical Music</h2>
      <p>After being obsessed with classical music for more than a year
      and I hardly listen to anything else, I found a great course to
      learn more about it.</p>
      <p>It was a 9-week course which was interesting, well laid out and
      useful. Most importantly, one doesn’t have to understand musical
      notation or have a background in music theory to follow through.
      And while I had a sense that the classical music world is huge,
      now I know that it’s massive. It feels like you are connected to a
      vast, God-sent, thousand-year inspiration ocean.</p>
      <p>It’s so sad I had to grow much older to appreciate it, but I
      choose to believe that it’s never too late for greatness!</p>
      <p>I highly recommend this Yale university free course to
      classical music fans: <a
