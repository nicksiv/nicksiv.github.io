    <h2>Deggoglifying 101: Disroot</h2>
      <p>One of the first steps you need to take in order to get free
      from the Google ecosystem is to get yourself a new email
      account.<br />
      You will think there are lots of options, but it’s a tough choice.
      Most of the free email services belong to the big tech in order to
      mine your personal data. Good and private email services cost
      money and they should. There are some free options like basic
      protonmail which got pretty famous in the last year, but I’ve
      decided I needed IMAP support for my email.</p>
      <p>After I’ve searched in <a
      href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools</a> and reviewed
      several services, <a href="https://disroot.org/">disroot</a> got
      my attention and I was in luck. They offer a free service which is
      a very good one for as long as I’m using it. Disroot offers also
      Nextcloud services, in which you can manage your files, calendar
      and contacts. Although the service is free, you can contribute
      through donations, because it worth it and you can save yourself
      some time by degooglifying even faster.</p>
      <p>Normally the next step after finding a new mail provider would
      be to choose a Nextcloud provider. If you don’t want to use
      disroot for these kind of data you can select one of many
      nextcloud servers offering free space in the <a
      href="https://nextcloud.com">nextcloud.com</a> website.</p>
      <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not affiliated with disroot,
      I’m just happy with their service, but there are some other useful
      providers into this directory: <a
      href="https://libreho.st">https://libreho.st</a>.</p>
      <p>In fewer words, there are many alternatives to Google and you
      can stop giving them your data if you are willing to put a little
      effort into it.</p>
