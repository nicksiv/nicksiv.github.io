    <h2>Donâ€™t ever say â€˜Whatever you wantâ€™</h2>
      <p><font size="7">ðŸ’†</font></p>
      <p>You think saying â€˜Whatever you wantâ€™ is something noble and
      well-mannered. You have good intentions saying that and I cannot
      disagree with that. But it sucks big time, you know it, even if
      you wonâ€™t admit it. Because deep inside you are in denial and all
      the others can see is a spineless push over.</p>
      <p>Are you a push over? Then state your opinion. Nowadays
      everybody strives to make their own stand out, so whatâ€™s wrong
      with you?</p>
      <p>Stating opinion says to the other person that you give a damn.
      You waste some energy to think and make your argument. Thatâ€™s what
      caring is. You contribute to the making of a decision and you
      offer yourself to carry its weight along. Donâ€™t leave it solely to
      the other party.</p>
      <p>So next time, do care a little.</p></main>
