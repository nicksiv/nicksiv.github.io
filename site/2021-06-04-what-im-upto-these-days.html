    <h2>What I’m up to these days…</h2>
      <p>Things are constantly changing and that’s a good thing, isn’t
      it?</p>
      <p>So, I was kind of forced to dual boot windows for work reasons
      (MS Teams is missing serious camera functionality on Linux) after
      6 years. I don’t care anymore so much about my operating systems,
      but the Windows annoyances are still there, and I have to get used
      to it (like my job). Anyway, with 8GB RAM I admit it runs
      smoothly.</p>
      <p>Except for the classic Office business applications, I only use
      the Brave browser, Winamp (I’ve missed this good old media player)
      and TiddlyDesktop for running a snap of my main wiki. It’s a
      fairly small setup.</p>
      <p>I’ve also started to learn touch typing. I have always wanted
      to do that but never actually did it. <a
      href="https://www.typingclub.com">typing club</a> is such a nice
      application for that. I will need additional practice for learning
      touch typing in Greek too, but we’ll see how it will go.</p>
