    <h2>What if photography dies?</h2>
      <p>I don’t remember when I shot the last photo with my phone. I’m
      sure it’s been months.</p>
      <p>In the meantime I see everyone else shooting everything.
      Sunsets, buildings and food. And lots of selfies. Oh God, It seems
      like yesterday that it was Oxford’s <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/11/19/living/selfie-word-of-the-year/index.html">word
      of the year (2013)</a>! What a revolution.</p>
      <p>Now you just shoot and store to the cloud. It’s so easy that
      nobody gets a chance to see a picture let alone print it. I agree
      with one of my favorite directors that this process is not
      photography and should get another name. For as long as it
      lasts.</p>
