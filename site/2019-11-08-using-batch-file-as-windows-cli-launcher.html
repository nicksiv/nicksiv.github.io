    <h2>Using a batch file for a handy Windows command line
launcher</h2>
      <p>For a Linux guy, working on a locked down Windows PC can be a
      pain sometimes. It would be nice to have my Linux terminal to run
      stuff but instead, I don’t even have access to a DOS prompt.</p>
      <p>To work down a solution, I’ve created a batch file and saved it
      under my user name’s root. I call it s.bat. That means whenever I
      run <strong>s</strong> followed by a command I get to launch
      something. And by that I don’t mean an application, but almost
      anything I can think of. Usually it’s Excel workbooks. Several
      files which I should open them every day and I have absolutely no
      interest in looking for desktop shortcuts or recent file lists
      with my mouse. I would kill to use just my keyboard.</p>
      <p>First I define the location of my Excel executable. Then I
      define one command named <em>report</em> which will open a
      specific Excel file.</p>
      <p>Here’s the code:</p>
      <pre class="batch"><code>set EXL=&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\excel.exe&quot;
if %~1 == report START &quot;&quot; %EXL% &quot;D:\monthReport.xlsx&quot;</code></pre>
      <p>Now all I have to do is bring up the Run dialog pressing Win+R
      and type in <em>s report</em>. That’s all.</p>
      <p>Later I have added a command for opening a folder:</p>
      <pre class="batch"><code>if %~1 == folder START &quot;&quot; &quot;N:\my Folder&quot;</code></pre>
      <p>I have a whole batch file with such commands. All I have to do
      is just remember them!</p>
      <p>I found this trick quite convenient and it has been helping me
      for a couple of years now without fail.</p>
