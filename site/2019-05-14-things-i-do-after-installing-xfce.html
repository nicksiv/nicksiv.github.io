    <h2>Things I do after installing XFCE</h2>
      <p>Over the years that I’m using Linux as my daily driver, I’ve
      tried many desktop managers and I always come back to XFCE. It’s
      combination of speed, simplicity and completeness, makes it ideal
      for older machines like the one I’m currently using.</p>
      <p>There are some tweaks I always do upon XFCE at first
      installation so I won’t forget…</p>
      <h4 id="remove-the-bottom-panel"><strong>1. Remove the bottom
      panel</strong></h4>
      <p>I always remove the bottom panel with those large icons that is
      created from the default configuration. I prefer to launch my
      applications from the dmenu or shortcut keys. To remove it press
      right click : Panel : Panel preferences. Choose panel 2 from the
      panel chooser and press the minus button.</p>
      <h4 id="optimize-font-display"><strong>2. Optimize font
      display</strong></h4>
      <p>Settings: Appearance: Fonts. You have to select Hinting: Full
      and Order: RGB. Now the Fonts look much clearer. Depending on your
      monitor you may need to try another combination for better
      results.</p>
      <h4 id="declutter-desktop"><strong>3. Declutter
      desktop</strong></h4>
      <p>Settings: Desktop: Icons. Select icontype: none for a clean
      desktop. This way there will not be no mounted volumes or home
      folders cluttering your workspace. If you are the type of person
      who saves everything on the desktop, leave this unchanged.</p>
      <h4 id="window-manager-optimizations"><strong>4. Window manager
      optimizations</strong></h4>
      <p>Settings: Window manager: keyboard. Select at least the Ctrl+F4
      shortcut which is used to go directly to the 4th virtual desktop,
      and reset it. This way you can close tabs in your browser using
      the Ctrl+F4 combination. I use it all the time that’s why I prefer
      to keep it that way.</p>
      <p>Settings: Window manager: Focus. I change the focus model to
      Focus follows mouse and I also check the option automatically
      raise windows when they receive focus. That way I don’t have to
      click a window to activate it. Just hover on it and it moves in
      front. (This is optional for me since it can bring up unwanted
      windows from the background, if they are larger than the one in
      the front).</p>
      <h4 id="keyboard-customizations"><strong>5. Keyboard
      customizations</strong></h4>
      <p>Add a second keyboard layout. Settings: Keyboard: Layout.
      Useful if you use an alternate layout like me. Uncheck use system
      defaults and add a layout. Set the change layout option to the
      desired keyboard shortcut (in my case it’s Alt+Shift)</p>
      <p>Add my standard keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard: Application
      shortcuts. Just press the add button and add the command/hotkey
      pairs. I use the following:</p>
      <p>Super+E : thunar (file manager) Ctrl+Alt+T: xfce4-terminal
      Super+D : dmenu_run (needs the package suckless-tools)</p>
      <h4 id="add-useful-plugins-to-the-top-panel"><strong>6. Add useful
      plugins to the top panel</strong></h4>
      <p>Right click on the top panel, select panel: add new items. I
      always add the keyboard layouts, the pulseAudio plugin, battery
      monitor (or Power manager plugin).</p>
      <h4 id="suspend-the-computer-when-closing-the-lid"><strong>7.
      Suspend the computer when closing the lid</strong></h4>
      <p>Settings: Power manager: General: Laptop lid set to
      suspend.</p>
      <h4 id="customize-the-applications-button"><strong>8. Customize
      the applications button</strong></h4>
      <p>Right click on applications menu and select properties. I
      usually choose another icon and uncheck the option show button
      title. Since I use the dmenu for launching applications, I like to
      minimize the space of this button.</p>
      <p>All those tweaks, make XFCE ready for my every day work,
      without much clutter and distracting items on the desktop.</p></main>
