    <title>nyk0-nomikon - It’s a wild world outside of Linux</title>

    <h2>It’s a wild world outside of Linux</h2>
      <p>I’m a happy Linux user. For two years now, Linux is my primary
      Operating System. I’m learning, trying things and sometimes
      changing distributions, like most users do. And I’m having a blast
      every time.</p>
      <p>I still keep a copy of Windows 10 on a partition, in case of
      emergency. The emergency arrived a couple of days ago, when my
      external hard disk failed while I was running a backup in
      clonezilla (It was my fault, for the record). Since Linux was not
      able to repair my drive using the NTFS tools and the manufacturer
      of the drive offered me a utility, I decided to give it a try.
      This was a good move from Western Digital (the manufacturer).</p>
      <p>This utility (WD Essentials) was able to fix my drive but I had
      to use Windows for it. Needless to say, I had to download every
      update Microsoft issued since last year and to wait patiently
      since I was not able to stop it. I mean really, there was no way.
      Of course there were hacks to stop this bloody thing, but no Linux
      user in the world would waste time in such way. Of course I could
      work in offline mode but the utility needed an older version of
      the .NET libraries so I had to download them. It was a
      nightmare!</p>
      <p>After a couple of hours, my drive was usable again -Thanks
      Western Digital- and Windows was shutting down for another thirty
      minutes installing updates… wasting me almost a whole afternoon
      just because I’m not their regular customer.</p>
      <p>Please let me boot my Debian!</p>
