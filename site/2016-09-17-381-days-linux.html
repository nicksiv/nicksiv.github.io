    <h2>381 days in Linux</h2>
      <p><font size=7>üêß</font></p>
      <p>I was waiting to complete a year exclusively in Linux to say
      that: I did it! After many years and too many installations I said
      goodbye to Windows forever.</p>
      <p>But how did I make it? I didn‚Äôt learn much more terminal
      commands from the time of my previous installation and I didn‚Äôt
      find the perfect distribution which magically solved all of my
      problems.</p>
      <p>I could say I‚Äôve had a change of mindset. Something not so
      simple when you‚Äôve been using Windows for all of your life. But
      looking back, that was the only thing I did.</p>
      <p>I found out that my failed attempts had to do with a
      misconception. I was expecting to find applications from the Linux
      world that would mimic exactly the ones from Windows I was using.
      Of course that would never happen and I would continue to switch
      operating systems back and forth, telling myself that Linux wasn‚Äôt
      yet mature, and I didn‚Äôt have time for that.</p>
      <p>And then I‚Äôve had an epiphany: What if I could completely
      redesign my work-flow and choose my tools again? That was a bit
      time consuming, but I‚Äôm just a home user, not a business. I made
      the conscious effort. And eventually it worked. Not because Linux
      came to me, but because I went to it. I shifted my world for it.
      Open source software worth it.</p>
      <p>So to all of you out there who face the same problem, this is
      my advice: Don‚Äôt expect to work with exactly the same way. Think a
      little different, invest a bit and the change will be
      inevitable.</p>
      <p>And of course take regular backups of your installations
      because if you break it you will feel lost and head back to
      Windows‚Ä¶</p>
