    <title>nyk0-nomikon - My Emacs writing setup</title>

  <body>
    <h2>My Emacs writing setup</h2>
      <h2 id="my-writing-setup">My writing setup</h2>
      <p>I like to use Emacs for as much as I can. Because I love it.
      It’s fast, open source and gives your fingers real superpowers. So
      anything I write, posts, prose or whatever I use Emacs and I got
      installed a package just for it. It’s called <strong>Writeroom
      mode</strong> and I it’s available to me at the push of a
      shortcut.</p>
      <figure>
      <img src="/images/wroom.png" alt="wroom" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">wroom</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I will show you how to set it up along with some general
      instructions:</p>
      <h3 id="setup-packages-and-install-writeroom-mode-for-noobs">Setup
      packages and install writeroom mode (for noobs)</h3>
      <p>To use writeroom mode you need to have access to the melpa
      package archive which is not setup by default into Emacs. Add the
      following to your .emacs file to enable it:</p>
      <p>;; Package setup (setq package-archives (quote ((“gnu” . “<a
      href="http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"
      class="uri">http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/</a>”) (“melpa” . “<a
      href="https://melpa.org/packages/"
      class="uri">https://melpa.org/packages/</a>”))))</p>
      <p>After that change, restart Emacs (or run a M-x eval-buffer) and
      run M-x package-list-packages. You can search the list of packages
      after appearing with C-s and find what you’re looking for, click
      on it and install.</p>
      <p><em>note: In emacs keyboard shortcuts M stands for Alt and C
      for Control. So M-x means Alt+X</em></p>
      <h2 id="my-function">My function</h2>
      <p>Writeroom mode makes Emacs full screen for distraction-free
      editing. But I needed bigger font for writing and the spellchecker
      on. So I quickly made a function (you can add it to your .emacs
      file after installing writeroom mode):</p>
      <p>;; Activate writeroon and spellcheck (global-set-key [f8]
      (lambda () (interactive)
      (writeroom-mode)(flyspell-mode)(text-scale-set
      1)(end-of-buffer)))</p>
      <p>Now pressing F8 turns any buffer into a distraction free editor
      with spell checking enabled. Writing in this environment feels
      like typing on a real typewriter. It helps me focus so much that I
      would recommend it to anyone who prefers minimal writing
      environments.</p>
      <p>You can customize additional settings of writeroom mode easily.
      Just run M-x customize-group and enter writeroom.</p>
