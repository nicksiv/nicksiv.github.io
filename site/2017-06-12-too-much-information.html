    <h2>Too much information</h2>
      <p>I stopped reading articles on the internet. Not entirely, but
      I’m consuming a much smaller volume of information now. After all,
      I realized that a big part of this information is totally useless
      or purely entertaining. So I thought, maybe trimming down this
      inflow should be beneficial. And I think it is, really. I have
      more time and I’m not constantly feeling that someone tries to
      sell me something. To manage this slim information feed, I’m using
      an old invention. The RSS feeds. They have been around for years,
      but depreciated in the social networking era. It’s a nice and
      elegant solution if you want to read what you choose. I hope it
      will stay around because the whole deal is really irritating: To
      get information, you have to buy it somehow. You should subscribe
      to a newsletter, buy a book, don’t block ads or sell your
      attention to social networks. Depend on someone else to “curate”
      the content to suit your needs. It is not my cup of tea.</p>
      <p>Most of the content creators nowadays are reproducing the same
      old stuff. You can easily arrive to such a conclusion if you
      follow a topic for a year or so. That whole deal makes me yawn and
      move ahead. So, I’ve cut my consumption, reading just what I care
      about and in the meantime I’m writing my own content. It’s one of
      the thousands of things, one can do with time. Maybe I haven’t got
      a lot to say but again, who has?</p></main>
