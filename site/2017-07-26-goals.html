    <title>nyk0-nomikon - Setting goals VS doing what you love</title>

  <body>
    <h2>Setting goals VS doing what you love</h2>
      <p>I don’t set goals. I never liked them. It is like racing
      against some unbeatable opponent. They are always subjected to
      further adjustments and keep reminding you of your own inadequacy.
      And alright there are SMART goals, you can define it and good luck
      in finding motivation to follow through.</p>
      <p>The thing is, I can’t just do what I like without consulting a
      schedule. I’m a byproduct of the Western productivity cult. I have
      to manage time the best I can. And doing what I like is not an
      optimal use of time.</p>
      <p>Of course you can set goals ON doing what you love. This would
      be perfect. But then, maybe you won’t love it anymore because you
      already have an optimal schedule of working 9 to 5.</p>
      <p>So, there’s the dilemma. Setting goals should make you more
      successful. Unless it doesn’t. But you’ll never believe that of
      course. There is always something more. Something better that you
      can do. Some different productivity evangelist to follow.</p>
      <p>It’s a vicious circle.</p>
      <p>If you don’t know what do you want to accomplish…</p>
