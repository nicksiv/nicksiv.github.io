    <h2>Trying something new</h2>
      <p>It’s always nice to try something new. I don’t usually get such
      opportunities but you never know when you will get one strange
      idea to try out.</p>
      <p>I had one idea regarding to my music listening habits. I always
      try to listen to albums. Lots of albums over the years. But there
      are times when I get tired of my choices. There are certain
      genres, publications and channels, into and outside the mainstream
      forming our taste in music. When I was younger I used to believe
      that my music was my choice. Needless to say, I was so wrong about
      that.</p>
      <p>So what music is next? Something unexpected.</p>
      <p>A <a
      href="https://www.randomlists.com/random-albums?qty=1">random
      album</a> that I will turn my attention to.</p>
      <p>And who knows? Maybe I stumble to something good which wasn’t
      so “hip” for me back then. This can be a refreshing exercise of
      modesty and humility.</p>
