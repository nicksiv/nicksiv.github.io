    <h2>Quitting Facebook made me happy</h2>
      <p>I gave a lot thought on the consequences of leaving Facebook.
      Way more than I should. I have been thinking about it for a couple
      of years. And then, one day I was on my way to become the weirdo
      who’s not on Facebook. And I did it. I deleted my ten year account
      and never looked back.</p>
      <p>I could write about some things that normally should make me
      mad, but I was very aware of, like the fact that I had to search
      through Google to find the permanent removal button for my
      account. I still don’t know how to find it through their menus. Or
      the awe I felt scanning through the “official” data that Facebook
      had gathered on me. Of course there is more data, especially from
      the time I had their sneaky app installed on my phone. The funny
      thing is that I was aware of this facts and still, it took me some
      years to make the decision. It was all an addiction.</p>
      <p>I smile secretly when I watch people on the streets, waiting in
      lines, getting their dopamine fix scrolling through their feeds. I
      can almost feel their anxiety, waiting for the next like, or the
      super funny meme that will make their day. Facebook is so big in
      my country that it became a synonym of the internet for the
      majority of people. You can find many who don’t know how to use a
      search engine or the email. But they use Facebook. It’s so
      annoying. I will not judge them. I just don’t want to be a part of
      this anymore. If it wasn’t for Richard Stallman’s <a
      href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">article</a>, I would
      still be in the process of thinking about it.</p>
      <p>In case you need more data, Salim Virani wrote this excellent
      <a href="http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/">piece</a> which is
      still relevant today.</p></main>
