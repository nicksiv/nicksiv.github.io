    <h2>The day I ditched software for a paper planner</h2>
      <h3 id="organizing-a-life">Organizing a life</h3>
      <p>I have been trying to organize my life for many years. It was
      so exciting at first. Then GTD came and a million applications
      emerged to fill its tool-agnostic void. It was then when I fell
      into oblivion.</p>
      <p>After years of trying and implementing ‘systems’ I found out
      that without having specifically defined your needs, the system in
      question cannot be functional for long. In other words, you
      shouldn’t adjust your needs around a specific system. It has to be
      the other way around.</p>
      <p>I wish I knew that, before wasting so much time on this
      particular concept. Fortunately, it came a time when I burned out.
      Nothing worked for me anymore. After many changes and setups, I
      got so disorientated that I didn’t know what I wanted. That was
      the time for me to erase everything. And I did it. I uninstalled
      apps, archived folders of data that I used to keep in my Dropbox
      account and cleared my Emacs bookmarks. It felt great! But I had
      to start over. As expected, I came to feel a bit insecure. I had
      no idea of my appointments in the next week so I proceeded to
      analyzing my most immediate needs.</p>
      <h3 id="starting-all-over">Starting all over</h3>
      <p>I picked up a 5 EUR paper planner (it wasn’t a time to be
      fancy) and sat on my desk. A made a list of all my appointments in
      a piece of paper using the data from my google calendar. I
      transferred only the ones I could not live without, into my new
      planner. Next, I made another list for my tasks. I looked at them
      one by one and transferred only the ones I have decided to really
      take action on a specific date into the paper planner. As it
      turned out, less than half of my data was useful. Having used so
      many systems and applications over the years, I came to gather
      lots of junk. The projects I would never start, stalled tasks, and
      years old someday items which I came so tired to see in front of
      me.</p>
      <p>Everything was clearer and I felt lighter and immediately more
      focused.</p>
      <p>Now I sit with my planner, wherever I like and make plans for
      the next day or the next week without having to over analyze
      trivial processes.</p>
      <p>I don’t still use this system, but I still consider the planner
      as a failsafe device for when it get too much with the digital
      counterparts.</p>
