    <title>nyk0-nomikon - Quarantine diaries</title>

  <body>
    <h2>Quarantine diaries</h2>
      <p>Okay, keeping a blog alive is hard. I never managed to do that
      more than some months. But I reboot quite often.</p>
      <p>So, it’s been almost 6 months. We are now in a 2nd quarantine
      due to COVID-19 and my blog still exists. I don’t like it very
      much, It’s not what I was going for when I started it (6 times)
      but I’ll keep it anyway.</p>
      <p>There are many things that occupied my mind all this time, and
      I will try to share. Like this big directory of personal blogs. I
      find some of the blogs inside really inspiring.</p>
      <p><a href="https://personalsit.es">https://personalsit.es</a></p>
      <p>Now as a big update from the previous months is that I grow
      fond of <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">Tiddlywiki</a> again.
      Yes, after many years of using it, I found out that there was a
      new version which is really awesome. Needless to say I started my
      own wiki mixing some practices of various knowledge management
      practices that are trending lately in the field. Then I found a
      guy (h0p3) with a huge <a href="https://philosopher.life">really
      inspiring wiki</a> and it made so much sense.</p>
      <p>This is a subject I rabbitholed a lot, but more updates on this
      in later posts.</p>
      <p>My most important task (MIT) of today, was writing this post to
      reboot!</p>
