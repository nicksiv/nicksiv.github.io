    <h2>Waking up Linux from USB keyboard</h2>
      <p>⌨</p>
      <p>Since I’ve got a spare old laptop in my hands, I’ve been
      thinking of turning it into a small media server. The problem is I
      want to connect it to a TV set, but without opening its lid since
      the screen is not working.</p>
      <p>The power button is as usual under the lid so I needed to find
      a way of switching it on without opening the lid, by using an
      external usb keyboard.<br />
      Apparently there is a way to wake the computer from suspend by
      enabling its specific USB port to power the computer. I found a
      nice how-to here: <a
      href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1213465">https://askubuntu.com/a/1213465</a>.
      The script I chose to use enables all the USB ports. I would like
      a cleaner approach of finding the specific USB port, but I
      couldn’t make it.</p>
      <p>After I ensured that the script works, I defined a shortcut key
      to suspend the system, mapping the command
      <code>systemctl suspend</code> to my <Super>+F12. Now I can wake
      up my server to be by pressing any key.</p>
