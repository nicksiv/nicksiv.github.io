    <h2>We will always have Santorini</h2>
      <p>Being in a constant melancholic state, somewhere in our 50ish
      day of the current confinement (I hate the term lockdown so much)
      I brought my memory back 5.5 months ago, in an almost empty,
      post-covid island of Santorini.</p>
      <p>It was strange to be there at first, since there was a
      record-low number of foreign tourists, but magestic at the same
      time.</p>
      <p>We had the priviledge of witnessing a different Santorini.</p>

      <p>That’s why you travel. That’s why you’re trying hard to live
      memoreable days.</p>
