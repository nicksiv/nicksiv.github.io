<h2>Emacs talks</h2>
<p>Emacs is more than an editor. Many say that it's an operating system with a decent editor.ðŸ˜²
<p>This is a list of inspirational emacs related talks I've watched over the years and I would definately suggest for someone interested in finding more about it.

  <ul>
    
<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM">Emacs Org-mode - a system for note-taking and project planning: Carsten Dominik</a>
<p>An absolute classic. The 2008 Google Talk by the creator of org-mode.

<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">Getting Started With Org Mode: Harry Schwartz</a>
<p>This should be watched by anyone who doesn't know about org-mode. Includes demonstration of many of the core features.

<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31gwvApo8zg&t=3459s">2019-07-24: All Things Org-Mode: Multiple Speakers</a>
<p>Mainly the part where John Wiegley explains his org-mode use.

<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtieBc3KptU">Emacs For Writers: Jay Dixit</a>
<p>A great talk I watched many years ago.

<li> <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/writing/">Emacs Turbo-Charges My Writing: Jeremy Friesen</a>
<p> My latest favorite talk from the EmacsConf 2023, inspired me to get on the emacs train once again.
