    <h2>I’m off with the infinity loops</h2>
      <p>Now that I have more free time and I can totally write new
      posts on this blog I can elaborate on the happy torture of the
      <strong>infinity loops</strong>.</p>
      <p>By infinity loops I’m referring to the endless feeds of
      information we are facing everyday in our mobile devices.</p>
      <p>The time I was spending on my mobile in various apps was way
      more than I have imagined. And I’m not referring to Facebook (it’s
      been 2 years since I’ve delete my profile). It was all the rest.
      Twitter, Reddit, YouTube and recently Netflix. Oh, mobile Netflix.
      What a way to waste huge amounts of time.</p>
      <p>That was until I realized those apps did not offer me any value
      and I uninstalled all of them. But this isn’t so easy as you may
      think. It is an addiction and like all the other addictions and
      you are in it <strong>for life</strong>. I didn’t make it from the
      first try. There were times that I was bored or slightly unhappy
      and cracked. I had quickly installed one of those apps to get a
      fix.</p>
      <p>This is how hooked we all are into this new form of global
      economy which makes people rich by sucking up our attention. I
      admit, It took constant struggle but at some point I’ve made
      it.</p>
      <p>Now the only thing I have in my mobile, is a feed reader and my
      firefox bookmarks. I’ve got always something to read but it
      doesn’t lead to a loop. Unfortunately many sites do not offer RSS
      feeds anymore to make you subscribe into mailing lists and
      Facebook or Twitter feeds, but oh well!</p>
      <p>Who knows what an <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">RSS feed</a> is nowadays
      anyway?</p>
      <p>The upside from all this? From the time I did this choice, I’ve
      been reading more physical books, and I have time to get bored,
      which had led me to some interesting ideas at last. So, I guess
      this whole deal is something worth struggling for.</p>
