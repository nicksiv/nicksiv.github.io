<h2>CWM (calm window manager)</h2>

<p>An underappreciated window manager, I use from time to time.
<p>On Ubuntu, to add cwm as a new window manager to the existing display manager, I had to edit the file <code>/usr/share/xsessions/cwm.desktop</code> and change the Exec command like this: <code>Exec=/etc/X11/XSession</code>
<p>That way my <code>~/.xsession</code> file runs normally.

  <h3>My configs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="dots/.cwmrc">.cwmrc</a>
<li><a href="dots/.xsession">.xsession</a>
</ul>
