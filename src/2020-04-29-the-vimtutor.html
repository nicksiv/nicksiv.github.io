    <h2>The vimtutor</h2>
      <p>I’m an <strong>emacs</strong> user and I love
      <strong>vim</strong> even if I know so little about it. I’ve
      learned the basic editing and movement commands and for some
      reason I got in the habit of using it to edit config files.<br />
      I know I could do that inside emacs, but when I’m working into a
      terminal I find it faster. And of course it is a great piece of
      software.</p>
      <p>Now on emacs, I found a nice way to load it with a custom
      config file. That way, creating a minimal config file you can have
      a very fast emacs into command line to edit text files:<br />
      <code>emacs -nw -q -l</code><br />
      Aliasing this to em I can use it instead of vi.</p>
