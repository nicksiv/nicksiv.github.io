    <h2>Resets</h2>
      <p>The new year is coming. It is a great opportunity for resets,
      at least to the extend of our abilities. A couple of days ago, I
      reset my computer data and my operating system. I reached a point
      where I could not think about new things without falling back into
      old patterns. Iâ€™m tired of the 2020 ideas, like my notes, the
      zettelkastens, emacs and miscellaneous linux explorations.</p>
      <p>I felt drained and meaningless. So I packed up everything into
      a zip file, backed it up and format my hard drive. I love Fedora,
      but since I was going for a new beginning I chose to go with
      Ubuntu. I like them both because my main need nowadays is to
      install an OS that works out of the box. Crazy customizations are
      not my cup of tea anymore.</p>
      <p>I just got my music and a couple of useful files.</p>
      <p>Today I was rethinking my whole blogging situation. The truth
      is, I donâ€™t know if anyone reads me and I fiddled with the idea to
      move to a platform where it would be easier to post, but Iâ€™ve
      decided to continue posting here for now. This <a
      href="https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/">brilliant
      chart</a> by Rakhim.org captures the blogging subject perfectly
      and punches in the face of the technically inclined bloggers like
      myself. This drawing is a lesson.</p>
      <p>Btw, Iâ€™m writing in vim now. I have no courage to setup emacs
      again.</p>
      <p>Either way, Iâ€™m a mess for the time being but I looked back and
      realized I have already wrote 22 posts this year. That canâ€™t be so
      bad right?</p>
