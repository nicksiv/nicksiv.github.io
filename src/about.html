<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Nyk0 is an <em>experimenting cybernaut</em>!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>There's not much to say about myself.
  <p>I support online freedom, privacy rights and free software.
  <p>I like sustainable and analog technologies, I enjoy great music and films, writing and reading physical books.

<p>I try to take things slow and make things everyday, either code, text or drawings.
This website has been through lots of rebuilds using numerous of software combinations.
<p>It is now generated just from plain HTML files, and a small and simple python script.
Needless to say it is still under development.

<p>My wallpapers come from <a href="https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers">nordic repo</a>
