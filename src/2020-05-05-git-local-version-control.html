    <h2>Git: local version control</h2>
      <p>Today I finally put all my important files under version
      control. But without uploading to a web service like github.
      Apparently you can do that. There were lots of things I didn’t
      quite get about git but now I know more.</p>
      <p>Even locally, git allows you to manage your own commits, view
      differences of versions, make branches and revert to older
      versions locally as well. Why the heck haven’t thought of this
      before?<br />
      I already knew the commands I had to run from the time I’ve kept a
      hugo blog, and the other time I kept a Jekyll blog. All I had to
      do was navigate to my folder and run:</p>
      <p><code>git init   git add .   git commit -m "comment"</code></p>
      <p>I also installed <a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> into my
      emacs, to have better control over my commits. It’s fast, it’s
      cool and now I won’t have to enter those commands again.</p>
