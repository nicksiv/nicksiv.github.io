    <h2>Gadgetbridge: Set your wrist band free!</h2>
      <p>Gadgetbridge is an android open source project to connect your
      wrist band to your mobile phone and manage it without sending data
      to the manufacturer through the official and heavy apps.</p>
      <p>It’s been a while since I don’t use my fitband to record daily
      activity or sleep. I really don’t care gathering all that data
      [*]. What I do, is use it as a watch and an alarm clock, which is
      in fact a very good idea. I love its vibrational only alarm that
      buzzes on your wrist, discrete and silent. And that’s where all
      the good stuff ends.</p>
      <p>Whenever I would try to connect to set or unset my alarms, the
      manufacturer’s app would download tons of data from my device,
      making me wait for ages since I don’t have it permanently
      connected via Bluetooth. Oh boy what a pain that was…</p>
      <p>After searching for an alternative solution, I found
      gadgetbridge. It took a bit of configuration and factory resetting
      my fitband, but it worked great!</p>
      <p>Now all I have to do is turn on Bluetooth, connect and do my
      job fast and easy. You can find it at F-droid and the project’s
      website <a href="https://gadgetbridge.org"
