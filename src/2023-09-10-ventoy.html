      <p>A multi boot USB is a really useful thing when setting up
      another linux distro, or need that specific tool to fix
      partitions, boot records or rescue data. I used to have one but
      Iâ€™ve erased it over the years. Guess what! I recently needed it so
      bad, when I had to shrink the only partition on my old laptop to
      make room for haikuOS.</p>
      <p>So, I stumbled upon <a
      href="https://www.ventoy.net">Ventoy</a>, which of course is open
      source and is supported from the most OS types. Its use is really
      simple. You setup a USB to Ventoy format and just copying all the
      ISOs you need into its partition.</p>
      <p>Booting up the stick, you are presented with a menu to choose
      which one to boot.</p>
      <p>Great tool, I will never erase my USB drive again!</p>
