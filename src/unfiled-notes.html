      One of the most relevant to my situation articles that I’ve read.
      I remember it even after 2 years. It is the description of the
      author’s struggle to build the perfect system. It’s a system based
      on emails but he doesn’t elaborate much on the specifics. The
      point is not the system but the psychology of the
      creator.</p></li>

      <p>I’ve installed it and played with it for a while. It is fast
      and totally different of what I’m used to. It even has its own
      todo and scheduling system. Maybe it’s too much? We’ll see.</p>
      <p>It will be refreshing to start again with a new tool but, as
      other tools the files titles are time stamps. Something that
      prevents you from working with those files outside of emacs. This
      is always has been a red flag for me.</p>
