    <h2>So vast the music‚Ä¶</h2>
      <p>Interesting lists for today that will keep me busy for a long
      time (and that‚Äôs if I won‚Äôt get bored).</p>
      <p>The first one is from the great <a
      href="https://rateyourmusic.com"
      class="uri">https://rateyourmusic.com</a> site which I‚Äôm very fond
      of. <a
      href="https://rateyourmusic.com/list/BlindNoldor/rym-charts-best-album-in-every-music-genre/">Best
      album in every music genre</a>: There are 2.078 genres with the
      best album for each. So far (I‚Äôm on page 4) I can testify that
      yes, there are that many genres. A bit over analytic to split
      music in so many sub-genres but a little browsing will prove that
      the music anyone listens to is such a small fragment of what‚Äôs
      really going on out there!</p>
      <p>The second one is a cool database of jazz records <a
      href="https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html">The
      Jazzomat Research Project</a> which contains 456 records including
      every little piece of info you can imagine including various
      stats, chords and even music transcription.</p>
      <p>Both of those lists really blew my mind and I much respect the
      people who put work into this! üôè</p>
