<h2>Emacs google calendar</h2>

<p>Due to lack of easy solutions to view my google calendar without having to open my browser, I have emacs downloading my calendar as ics.
<p>I use my private address and make a diary out of it. Then it shows up in my agenda.
<p>Of course I cannot create new entries, but it suits me fine.
  <p>To update the calendar I run the function <code>nyko/getcals</code>

<pre>
  
  ; DIARY WITH GOOGLE CALENDAR
  (setq diaryDir "~/Documents/diary/")
  (setq diary-file (concat diaryDir "nyk0"))
  (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)
  (setq org-agenda-insert-diary-extract-time t)
  (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-sort-entries t)
  (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-include-other-diary-files)
  (add-hook 'diary-mark-entries-hook 'diary-mark-included-diary-files)
  (setq diary-list-entries-hook '(diary-include-other-diary-files diary-sort-entries))

  ; calendars you want to download
  ; each item links to a remote iCal calendar
  (setq calendars
    '(
      ("nyk0" . "private address of galendar file")
       ))

  (defun getcal (url file)
  "Download ics file and add it to file"
  (let ((tmpfile (url-file-local-copy url)))
  (icalendar-import-file tmpfile file)
  (kill-buffer (car (last (split-string tmpfile "/"))))))

  (defun nyko/getcals ()
  "Load a set of ICS calendars into Emacs diary files"
  (interactive)
  (find-file (concat diaryDir "nyk0"))
  (erase-buffer)
  (getcal "private address of google calendar" (concat diaryDir "nyk0"))
  (kill-this-buffer)

  )

</pre>

<p>In order to import more than one calendars, you need to update each calendar to its own file and create a global diary file listing all the calendars.
<p>Then you just define the global diary file as your default diary with <code>(setq diary-file (concat diaryDir "globalfile"))</code>
