    <h2>Listening to 1 album</h2>
      <p>The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a dangerous thing. Especially
      in music. So I’ve designed my revolution:<br />
      No more always available playlists with greatest hits and
      algorithms based on playing history, related bands and a downward
      spiral towards musical consumerism!<br />
      I’m listening to one album for days. That’s all. This way I can
      understand it. I can sink inside it and take whatever it has to
      give me.<br />
      I only have to make this choice a couple times a month.<br />
      What’s the next album will be?</p>
