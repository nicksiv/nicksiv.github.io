    <h2>Mimetism</h2>
      <p>Reading <a
      href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/25-anti-mimetic-tactics-for-living-a-counter-cultural-life/">this</a>,
      I realized that almost everything I do or like is just mimetic
      desire.</p>
      <p>Now Iâ€™m asking myself questions like: why do I like the things
      I like? Why donâ€™t I like the things that noone likes?</p>
      <p>Apparently there is always some <a
      href="https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-101">model</a>
      that tells us what is good to like.</p>
      <p>Oh my, how disappointing is this? ðŸ˜ž We are the sum of out
      models.</p>
