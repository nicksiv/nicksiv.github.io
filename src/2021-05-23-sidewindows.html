    <h2>Installing Windows 10 on the side</h2>
      <p>I needed to install MS Windows for work. I haven’t dual-booting
      Windows since 2015, but our communication software which is
      Microsoft Teams, is well known for missing important features in
      Linux. In my <a href="mailto:work@home"
      class="email">work@home</a> environment I need mainly the camera
      background blur option and the ability to screen share just one
      window and not my entire system. The downside of this, is the
      Alt-tab window switching behavior which is customizable in Linux
      (but not in Windows) and I could use it without problems into my
      remote system.</p>
      <p>So after making the choice, I made space on my HD (I tried
      virtual box but Windows were very slow) but Windows wouldn’t
      install because my laptop had MBR and not GPT records table.</p>
      <p>So I used this: <a

      class="uri">https://serverfault.com/questions/963178/how-do-i-convert-my-linux-disk-from-mbr-to-gpt-with-uefi</a></p>
      <p>That way I created a GPT record and Windows was able to be
      installed.</p>
      <p>But I’ve lost my GRUB. The above’s article solution did not
      cover this one so I needed to boot trough an Ubuntu live USB and
      install Boot-Repair.</p>
      <p><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair"
      class="uri">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair</a></p>
      <p>In order to use it I had to disable legacy boot from BIOS and
      after that booting with the Ubuntu live USB. Then, running the
      application I used the recommended settings button and the problem
      solved. Now I’m dual booting Windows in GPT mode.</p>
