    <h2>My Thinkpad</h2>
      <p>Remember when I intently limited myself by using an old
      laptop?<br />
      You don’t? I do, because that period lasted for over a year (as I
      mentioned in my previous post). The screen of this old Toshiba
      laptop died. And the it came back and then it died again. Probably
      some of the thin wires which connects the screen have wore off. I
      mean, who knows how many thousand times that lid opened and closed
      over the years?</p>
      <p>I realized the limiting period was over, and I had to start
      looking for a new laptop. Sorry, not new, refurbished. After all,
      Linux powered my old machine for so long. I didn’t need something
      with state of the art specifications able to run Windows and play
      the latest games.</p>
      <h4 id="now-what-machine-should-i-choose">Now, what machine should
      I choose?</h4>
      <p>My only requirement was to be Linux friendly and to have more
      RAM than 2GB.</p>
      <p>There was a guy, I’ve read a post he wrote (or maybe on reddit,
      I don’t remember) who mentioned the Thinkpads as one of the best
      for supporting Linux. Having that in mind, I did a little
      research, only to verify his sayings.</p>
      <p>Thinkpads are business laptops, very durable, repairable and
      expandable, usually with very good specifications. There is active
      support from the maker (now lenovo) and you can easily find any of
      its parts for replacements. You can even download a lenovo service
      manual! This was what I wanted to find out.<br />
      I wish I could find this guys name to write him a thank you
      note.</p>
      <p>Which brought me to the next question:</p>
      <h4 id="what-linux-distribution-should-i-install">What Linux
      distribution should I install?</h4>
      <p>I was tired of tinkering and keeping a minimal desktop. After
      all, this was mandatory for keeping my old laptop to life, but not
      anymore. So I wanted something big and stable. Something with
      Gnome 3 which I’ve never had the opportunity to use in all of its
      glory. I was torn between Ubuntu and Fedora.</p>
      <p>I had plenty of experience with Ubuntu. I’ve even tried some of
      the various flavors: Xubuntu, Budgie, Lubuntu and Mint. I’ve used
      Fedora for a while, as a distro-hoping experience and I had a
      really good experience with it. So I thought: New laptop, a new
      beginning!</p>
      <p>Now I’m a happy Fedora user. I needed about an hour to setup my
      software and data, and now it works perfectly. I’m really pleased
      with Gnome. It’s been a couple of years since I’ve last used it
      and I’ve got to say it feels very natural.</p>
      <h4 id="ps-things-i-love-about-my-thinkpad">PS: Things I love
      about my Thinkpad</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The keyboard light next to the webcam so you can write in the
      dark</li>
      <li>The rich BIOS settings. There’s even a setting to switch
      Fn/Control keys (there are many complaints online about the
      control key location)</li>
      <li>The leaf left/right keys above the cursor keys switch buffers
      in my emacs out of the box!</li>
      </ul>
