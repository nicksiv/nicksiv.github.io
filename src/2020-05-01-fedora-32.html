    <h2>Fedora 32</h2>
      <p>Finally, I was able to make the change. And It was a good
      one.<br />
      The installation went smooth, except for one little bug in
      anaconda installer.</p>
      <p>Anaconda couldnâ€™t auto-create the partition scheme from the
      first location selector screen. I had to select advanced, manually
      remove my old partitions and then let the installer auto-create
      the new ones. After that everything went well.</p>
      <p>The new Gnome is smoother and faster. I only had to install the
      <code>gnome-tweak-tool</code> and the rpmfusion repositories from
      <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/">https://rpmfusion.org/</a>. As
      for Gnome extensions I have installed <a
      href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/">dash
      to panel</a>.</p>
      <p>I am happy the there are no snaps here: Running the
      <code>lsblk</code> command, lists only my real partitionsðŸ˜œ. After
      installing the updates, I added my favorite applications: emacs
      (version 26.3 and orgmode 9!), ledger, Thunderbird, VLC,
      Nextcloud, Tor browser and of course Minecraft.</p>
      <p>The whole experience so far seems really nice, and thatâ€™s good
      if you plan to keep a distro for years (yes, Iâ€™m done with distro
      hopping).</p>
